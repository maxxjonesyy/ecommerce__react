**About {
This project was my introductory to learning React, it was good practice to dive into the deep end on a larger project than i would usually build. I learnt a lot of new things - some of these consist of React state, useEffect, my preferred folder structure methods and and Object Orientated Programming for the shopping car functionality.
}**

**Technologies {
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Material UI, React Router DOM, SweetAlert, EmailJS
}**

If you take the time to have a read through the code and have some constructive criticism feel free to send it my way!
